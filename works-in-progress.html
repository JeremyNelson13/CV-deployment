  <h2>Halloween Game Jam: Point and Click Game</h2>
  <!-- make this a list or table lol -->
  <p>
    One month long game jam with some friends. I am handling development and scripting, and assisting with design and writing.
    Technologies used: AGS (Adventure Games Studio), GIMP, [any other tech used]. AGS is a game engine for point and click adventures
    found [link] here. It's scripting is done according to OOP principles and is based heavily on C/C++ languages. The game itself is a
    tongue-in-cheek pulp fiction style adventure in first person. Assets done by [kerrigan and mork links if they want to be linked to].
